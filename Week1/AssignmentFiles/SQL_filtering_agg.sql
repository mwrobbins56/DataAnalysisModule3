-- I have used navicat.com, geeksforgeeks.org, w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com to figure out 
-- a lot of the commands that I used in many of these queries. 
-- I had seen the use of COUNT, ROUND, and SUM before, but hod to research the CASE and the 
-- DATE commands stuff, a lot. I needed a lot of help with Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8, Q11, and Q12.

-- Q1) Compute total items per order.
--     Return (order_id, total_items) from order_items.
select order_id, COUNT(*) as total_items
from order_items
group by order_id;
-- Q2) Compute total items per order for PAID orders only.
--     Return (order_id, total_items). Hint: order_id IN (SELECT ... FROM orders WHERE status='paid').
select order_id, COUNT(*) as total_items
from orders
where status = 'paid'
group by order_id;
-- Q3) How many orders were placed per day (all statuses)?
--     Return (order_date, orders_count) from orders.
select DATE(order_datetime), COUNT(*) as orders_count 
from orders
group by DATE(order_datetime);
-- Q4) What is the average number of items per PAID order?
--     Use a subquery or CTE over order_items filtered by order_id IN (...).
select AVG(total_items) as average_items_per_pd_order 
from (select order_id, SUM(quantity) as total_items
from order_items 
where order_id in 
(select order_id
from orders
where status = 'paid')
group by order_id)
as order_totals;
-- Q5) Which products (by product_id) have sold the most units overall across all stores?
--     Return (product_id, total_units), sorted desc.
select product_id, total_units
from (select product_id , SUM(quantity) as total_units 
from order_items
group by product_id)
as product_sales
order by total_units desc;
-- Q6) Among PAID orders only, which product_ids have the most units sold?
--     Return (product_id, total_units_paid), sorted desc.
--     Hint: order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE status='paid').
select product_id, SUM(quantity) as total_units_sold
from order_items
where order_id in
(select order_id from orders where status = 'paid')
group by product_id 
order by total_units_sold desc;
-- Q7) For each store, how many UNIQUE customers have placed a PAID order?
--     Return (store_id, unique_customers) using only the orders table.
select store_id, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers
from orders 
where status = 'paid'
group by store_id;
-- Q8) Which day of week has the highest number of PAID orders?
--     Return (day_name, orders_count). Hint: DAYNAME(order_datetime). Return ties if any.
select day_name, orders_count
from (select DAYNAME(order_datetime) as day_name,
COUNT(*) as orders_count
from orders
where status = 'paid'
group by day_name
)
as day_counts
where orders_count = (select MAX(orders_count)
from (select COUNT(*) as orders_count
from orders
where status = 'paid'
group by DAYNAME(order_datetime)
)
as max_counts);
-- Q9) Show the calendar days whose total orders (any status) exceed 3.
--     Use HAVING. Return (order_date, orders_count).
select DATE(order_datetime) as order_date, COUNT(*) as orders_count 
from orders
group by DATE(order_datetime)
having orders_count > 3; 
-- Q10) Per store, list payment_method and the number of PAID orders.
--      Return (store_id, payment_method, paid_orders_count).
select store_id, payment_method, COUNT(*) as paid_orders_count
from orders
where status = 'paid'
group by store_id, payment_method
order by store_id, payment_method;
-- Q11) Among PAID orders, what percent used 'app' as the payment_method?
--      Return a single row with pct_app_paid_orders (0–100).
select 
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN payment_method = 'app' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as pct_app_paid_orders
from orders
where status = 'paid';
-- Q12) Busiest hour: for PAID orders, show (hour_of_day, orders_count) sorted desc.
select HOUR(order_datetime) as hour_of_day, COUNT(*) as orders_count
from orders
where status = 'paid'
group by hour_of_day
order by orders_count desc;
